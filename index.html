  </h1>
 <p class="P1"> Kenya Airways Ltd., more commonly known as Kenya Airways, is the flag carrier airline of Kenya. The company was founded in 1977, after the dissolution of East African Airways. Its head office is located in Embakasi, Nairobi, with its hub at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.The airline became a member of SkyTeam in June 2010, and is also a member of the African Airlines Association since 1977.</p>

    EARLY YEARS
  </h2>
  <p class="P2">Kenya Airways was established by the Kenyan government on 22 January 1977, following the break-up of the East African Community and the consequent demise of East African Airways (EAA). On 4 February 1977, 90  two Boeing 707-321s leased from British Midland Airways inaugurated operations, serving the Nairobi–Frankfurt–London route. On internal and regional flights, the carrier deployed aircraft formerly operated by the EAA consortium, such as one Douglas DC-9-52 and three Fokker F-27-200s. In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient. The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services.Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years</p>

    1980s–1990s: EXPANSION AND PRIVATISATION
  </h2>
  <p class="P3">
    In July 1980, the airline had 2 100 employees and a fleet of three Boeing 707-320Bs, one Boeing 720B, one DC-9-30 and three Fokker F-27-200s. At this time, Addis Ababa, Athens, Bombay, Cairo, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Jeddah, Kampala, Karachi, Khartoum, London, Lusaka, Mauritius, Mogadishu, Rome, Salisbury, Seychelles and Zurich were among the airline's international destinations, whereas domestic routes radiated from Nairobi to Kisumu, Malindi, Mombasa and Mumias. A Nairobi–Bombay nonstop route was launched in 1982 using Boeing 707-320Bs. A year later, the company commenced serving Tanzania while flights to Burundi, Malawi and Rwanda were launched in 1984. Capacity on the European routes was boosted in November 1985 with the incorporation of an Airbus A310-200 leased from Condor. Kilimanjaro was first served in March 1986. That year, the airline ordered two Airbus A310-300s. Kenya Airways was the first African carrier to acquire the type, and they were the first wide-bodies ordered by the company. Funded with a US$20,000,000 (equivalent to $53,394,050 in 2022) loan, the delivery of these two aircraft took place in May and September 1986. They flew on the Kenya–Europe corridor, and permitted Kenya Airways to return the A310-200 to the lessor.] In early 1988, the carrier ordered two Fokker 50s; for domestic routes, the airline received the first of these aircraft at the end of the year. Also in 1988, the lease of a third A310-300 was arranged with the International Lease Finance for a ten-year period; the aircraft joined the fleet in November 1989. Leased from Ansett Worldwide, the first Boeing 757-200 was received in January 1990, whereas a third Fokker 50 was acquired in October the same year. By late 1991, two Boeing 737-200s had been leased from Guinness Peat Aviation.

    PERSONAL EXPERINCE
  </h2>
  <p class="P5">
    I travelled via Kenya airways from Accra or Kotoka International Airport to Mumbai or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. It was a very exciting tripas we had a transit time of 10 hours. We went around the airport, which was in a circular shape. We went in a Boeing 737-800. The in-flight entertainment was good and the food was also good.
